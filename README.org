* Introduction

  A collection of python3 libraries.

* Install on Linux

For example, install package ~iotools~

#+begin_src shell
cd iotools
pip3 install -e .
#+end_src

This will install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source file
will be immediately available to other users of the package on our system.
