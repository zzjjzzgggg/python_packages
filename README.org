* Introduction

  A collection of python3 libraries.

* Install on Linux

  Your can selectively install each individual library. For example, to install
  package ~iotools~, follow the commands below.

  #+begin_src shell
  cd iotools
  pip3 install -e .
  #+end_src

  This will install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source file
  will be immediately available to other users of the package on our system.
