* Introduction

  A collection of python3 libraries.

* Install on Linux

  Clone or download the repository.
  #+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/zzjjzzgggg/python_packages.git
  #+end_src

  Now you can selectively install each individual library. For example, to install
  package ~iotools~, run the following command.
  #+begin_src shell
  pip3 install -e iotools
  #+end_src

  This will install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source file
  will be immediately available to other users of the package on our system.
